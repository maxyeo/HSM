                    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>All customers of Hopkins Student Movers agree to the terms and conditions here laid forth. Any violation of the terms and conditions, on the part of the customer, voids all liability held by HSM.</p>
                    <h3>Service Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>HSM services shall include the pickup, movement, and delivery of the designated items of the Customer. HSM will not hold property for the Customer. HSM is no way liable for the property prior to pick up at the designated location or after delivery to the designated location.</p>
                    <h3>Commodities Handled and Restrictions on Service</h3>
                    <p>HSM provides a moving service subject to a number of restrictions. The Customer accepts full responsibility and liability for any damages or losses that result from the Customer’s failure to adhere to these service restrictions. No moving service shall be rendered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For hazardous materials.</li>
                        <li>For firearms or any combustible material.</li>
                        <li>For any items that are prohibited by law or regulations of any federal, state, provincial, or local government in the U.S.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>HSM reserves the right to refuse any package which by reason of the dangerous or other character of its contents is liable, in the judgment of HSM, to be hazardous or otherwise endanger employees or damage equipment. HSM reserves the right to open and inspect any package tendered to it for moving.</p>
                    <p>The Customer agrees that the safe packing of items, prior to a move, is the sole responsibility of the Customer. HSM will not be held liable for damages caused by improper packing.</p>
                    <p>We do have the capacity to use JHU student vans, but are only able to use those for moves between JHU owned buildings or JHU rented storage facilities.</p>
                    <h3>Insurance</h3>
                    <p>HSM automatically protects each item moved against loss or damage up to a value of $100. Unless the Customer purchases additional insurance from an outside source, the Customer agrees that the released value of each item is no greater than $100 and that HSM’s liability is limited to $100.</p>
                    <p>To the extent that the Customer does not obtain insurance coverage for the full value of their personal property moved with HSM, the Customer hereby agrees to assume all risk of damage or loss. HSM and HSM’s agents, affiliates, authorized representatives and employees will not be responsible for, and the Customer hereby releases from, any loss, liability, claim, expense, damage to property or injury to persons that could have been insured (including, without limitation, any loss arising from the active or passive acts, omission or negligence of HSM or its agents, affiliates, authorized representatives and employees).</p>
                    <h3>Insurance Claims</h3>
                    <p>The Customer agrees to first claim any loss against any insurance carried by the Customer or the Customer’s Academic Department or controlling affiliation, if available. The Customer will make claims against HSM only after exhausting other areas of coverage.</p>
                    <p>Claims for loss of, or damage to, the Customer’s property must be filed with HSM by requesting a claims form from HSM. Claims shall be deemed waived if not filed within 10 days following the move of the damaged item. Upon receipt of a completed Claim Form and any required documentation, HSM will process the claim and issue a formal reply to the Customer within 30 days of receipt of the Claim Form and documentation. HSM will pay the lesser of the following claim amounts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cost of reasonably restoring the property to its condition immediately before the move (applies only in the case of damaged items), which is to be no more than $100, unless additional insurance was purchased.</li>
                        <li>The actual replacement value of the property, (applies only in the case of lost items).</li>
                        <li>The value to which it is insured by HSM (which is less than $100).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Pricing and Payment</h3>
                    <p>The Customer agrees to pay the total cost of the services provided by HSM based on the number of workers provided, hours worked, transportation materials used, and the exact prices therewith associated, as described on the HSM website.</p>
                    <p>Customers will be charged for the full first hour of a move regardless of how long the move takes.</p>
                    <p>All charges for services are due within thirty days of receipt of the HSM invoice. All accounts must be paid by check or internal transfer.</p>
                    <p>The Customer acknowledges that they remain indebted to HSM for any balance owed on their account as a result of an invalid check or failed cash transaction.</p>
                    <h3>Equipment</h3>
                    <p>In the case that damage is sustained by HSM moving equipment, due to negligence on the part of the customer or violations of the restriction on material that will be moved, the Customer agrees to cover in full all damages sustained by HSM equipment, including the replacement of unusable equipment.</p>
                    <h3>Disposal</h3>
                    <p>HSM’s disposal facilities are limited to those of the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus, and HSM will thus not dispose of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Batteries of any sort.</li>
                        <li>Hazardous material of any sort.</li>
                        <li>Recyclable electronics.</li>
                        <li>Any of the materials mentioned in the section of this agreement titled, “Commodities Handled and Restrictions on Service.”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Waiver</h3>
                    <p>Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Customer waives any claims for damage or loss of any property against HSM and its employees. The Customer expressly releases and holds HSM, and its agents, affiliated representatives, and employees harmless from any and all costs of processing any claim or defending any claim arising from this Agreement. The Customer expressly acknowledges that HSM is not a professional mover or common carrier and waives the right to hold HSM to any laws or standards governing professional movers or carriers.</p>
                    <h3>Applicable Law</h3>
                    <p>This Agreement shall be governed, interpreted, and construed according to the law of the State of Maryland. The Customer agrees that any court action pertaining to this agreement shall be conducted in courts in the State of Maryland.</p>
                    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                    <p>The Customer acknowledges that there are no representations, warranties, or Agreements by or between the parties, which are not fully set forth herein and no representative of HSM or HSM’s agents is authorized to make any representations, warranties, or Agreements other than as expressly set forth herein. This Agreement may only be amended by a writing signed by the parties.</p>
                    <p>By hiring Hopkins Student Movers, I understand that the movers will perform the move to their best ability. I also understand that in certain cases Hopkins Student Movers will be unable to perform the move if the movers think that moving the item poses a health or injury risk.</p>
                    <p>I understand that hiring by hiring students, class schedules come first. In some instances, if a move goes longer than expected – it will have to be completed at a later date specified by the movers if the move conflicts with class schedules.</p>
